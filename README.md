# Expense Splitter

A React Native mobile application that helps friends and groups easily split expenses and calculate fair settlements.

![Expense Splitter App](https://example.com/app-screenshot.png)

## Features

- **Easy Expense Tracking**: Add people and their contributions to a shared expense
- **Automatic Settlement Calculation**: The app automatically calculates the optimal way to settle debts
- **Multiple Currencies**: Support for USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, CHF, NOK, PLN and more
- **Share Settlements**: Generate and share a visual summary of expenses and settlements
- **Persistent Storage**: All splits are saved locally on your device
- **Intuitive UI**: Clean, modern interface with smooth animations

## How It Works

1. **Create a Split**: Start a new expense split and give it a name
2. **Add Contributors**: Enter each person's name and how much they paid
3. **View Settlements**: The app automatically calculates who owes whom to balance everything fairly
4. **Share Results**: Generate a shareable image with all payment details

## Settlement Algorithm

The app uses an optimized algorithm to minimize the number of transactions needed to settle all debts:

1. Calculate each person's fair share (total amount รท number of people)
2. Determine who paid more than their share (creditors) and who paid less (debtors)
3. Match debtors with creditors to create the minimum number of transactions
